## Suggested Corrections

### In the repo's README file Under 'Features' / pub-obsidian

- the link to `Obsidian.md' has a typo

### Under 'Setting up meta / Navigation automatic generation'

- link to "this documentation repository" goes to the old repository link

### Blog URL is 'index-0'

Under '02-Blog', I've created a README.md file with the name 'Blog', and slug of 'blog'. In the footer navigation on the 'Home' page, the blog page's url is 127.0.0.1:8000/index-0/

I can't figure out how to change the url to 'Blog'.
